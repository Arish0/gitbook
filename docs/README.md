\
&#x20;**Arbitration Claim Overview:**\
&#x20;  The MineX Platform is designed to securely facilitate the arbitration claim process, allowing only verified funders to access, view, and engage with listed claims. The platform ensures confidentiality and targeted visibility, maintaining the integrity of both claimants and funders throughout the arbitration journey.\
\
**Funder Registration**

The **Funder Registration** page allows potential funders to sign up on the platform in order to gain access to all arbitration claim listings submitted by claimants. This registration process ensures that only verified and onboarded funders can view sensitive project details, maintaining the integrity and privacy of claim-related data.

#### **Claimant**

A **Claimant** is a registered user on the platform who submits an **arbitration claim**. These claims typically contain comprehensive details about a mining project and are submitted for visibility and potential funding by registered funders. Claimants can track the status of their submissions through their dashboard and receive notifications based on admin actions.

#### **Arbitration Claim**

An **Arbitration Claim** refers to a detailed listing created by a claimant, which includes essential information about a mining project. Once submitted, the claim enters a review process managed by the platform's admin team. Approved claims become visible to funders for consideration, while rejected claims are archived with proper notifications.\
&#x20;

**Notification Mail**

The platform sends automated notification emails to funders, claimants, and administrators at key stages of the arbitration claim process. Funders receive a registration confirmation email containing their login credentials upon registering, followed by an onboarding confirmation that includes their company details and a signed Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA). When a funder accesses arbitration claim details for the first time, an OTP (One-Time Password) email is sent for secure verification. Additionally, once a claim is approved by the admin, a claim listing notification is dispatched to all registered funders, informing them of the newly available listing. For claimants, a confirmation email is sent once their submitted claim is approved and successfully listed on the platform. In case a claim is rejected during the review process, the claimant receives a rejection notification along with a status update.

#### **Admin Panel – Claim Management Overview**

The Admin Panel offers a centralized system for managing arbitration claims across three key sections. The Arbitration Claim Approval Management section displays all newly submitted claims in a pending state, where admins can review, edit, approve, or reject each entry. Approved claims are moved to the Arbitration Claim Management section, where they are tracked and maintained, with the option to export claim data to a CSV file. Finally, rejected claims are stored in the Rejected Claims section, serving as a reference for all disapproved submissions. Throughout the process, appropriate email notifications are automatically triggered to ensure transparency and timely communication with all involved parties.\
