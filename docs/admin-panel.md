#### **Arbitration Claim Approval Management**

**Overview**

The Arbitration Claim Approval Management module handles the review and status update of claims submitted by users. Once a user submits a claim, it is marked as **Pending** and listed on their dashboard. A **notification email** is automatically sent to the admin, indicating that a new claim is awaiting review.

***

#### **Approval Process**

* When a claim is **approved** by the admin:
  * A **confirmation email** is sent to the user who submitted the claim.
  * A **notification email** is also sent to all registered funders on the platform, informing them about the newly approved claim.

***

#### **Rejection Process**

* If a claim is **rejected** by the admin:
  * A **rejection notification email** is sent to the user who submitted the claim.
  * The claim is moved from the Pending list to the **Rejected Claims** section.

#### **Arbitration Claim Management**

All claims that receive approval from the admin are automatically moved to the **Arbitration Claim Management** section. This section serves as the central repository for all successfully approved claims. Within this section, users have access to an **export functionality** that allows them to download all approved and drafted claims in **CSV format** for record-keeping or reporting purposes. In addition, once a claim is approved, a **notification email** is sent to the respective user who submitted the claim, informing them of the successful approval. This ensures transparency and keeps the user informed about the current status of their submission.

***

#### **Rejected Claims**

Claims that do not meet the approval criteria are moved to the **Rejected Claims** section. When an admin rejects a claim, it is automatically transferred from the pending approval list to this section for proper tracking and record maintenance. The user who submitted the claim will receive a **rejection notification email**, clearly informing them of the decision and completing the review process. This mechanism helps maintain a clear separation between approved and rejected claims while ensuring timely communication with the claimants.
