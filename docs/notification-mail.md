# Notification mail

### **FUNDERS**

#### **1. Registration Confirmation**

Upon successful registration as a funder, a confirmation email is sent containing the username and password associated with the newly created account. This serves as an acknowledgment of the registration and provides the necessary credentials for account access.

***

#### **2. Confirmation of Onboarding**

Once the onboarding process is completed, the funder receives a detailed email that includes the company information submitted during registration, along with the digitally signed Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA). This confirms that the onboarding process is finalized and the funder is officially part of the platform.

***

#### **3. OTP Mail**

When a registered funder attempts to view the details of an arbitration claim, an OTP (One-Time Password) email is automatically triggered. This email contains a secure verification code sent to the funder’s registered email address, adding an extra layer of authentication before granting access to sensitive claim details.

***

#### **4. Claim Listed Notification**

After a user-submitted arbitration claim is reviewed and approved by the admin, a claim listed notification is sent to all registered funders. This email informs them about the newly listed and approved claim, ensuring they stay updated on new investment opportunities.

***

### **CLAIMANT:**

#### **1. Successful Claim Listed Notification**

Once a claimant submits an arbitration claim and it is approved by the admin, a confirmation email is sent to the claimant. This email notifies the user that the claim has been successfully listed on the platform and is now visible to funders.

***

#### **2. Claim Rejection Notification**

If the submitted arbitration claim is rejected by the admin, the claimant receives a rejection notification email. This email informs the claimant that their claim has not been approved, along with any relevant details or reasons for the rejection, ensuring transparency in the review process.

***

### **ADMIN:**

#### **1. New Claim Submission Notification**

When a user submits an arbitration claim, it is placed in the Pending state and listed under the Arbitration Claim Approval Management section. A notification email is automatically sent to the admin's registered email address, informing them of the newly submitted claim awaiting review.From the Arbitration Claim Approval Management panel, the admin has full access to review each submitted claim. Before taking any action, the admin also has the ability to edit the claim details if needed—ensuring accuracy and completeness. After review, the admin can either approve the claim, which moves it to the approved claims section and notifies the relevant users, or reject the claim, triggering a rejection notification email to the claimant.
