An **Arbitration Claim** is a formal listing created by a **seller** on the MineX platform. It contains verified information about a mining project that is either under dispute, undergoing legal clarification, or available for structured funding opportunities. The arbitration claim process ensures that each project is transparently reviewed, securely handled, and made accessible only to **verified funders**.

Each claim typically includes:\
**Arbitration details:**

* Claim Name
* Forum/Seat of Arbitration
* Name of Respondent
* Sector
* Basis of Claim
* Status of Claim
* Quantum of Claim(USD$)
* Name of Law Firm Acting
* Intension
* Summary of Claim
* Infrastructure Images
* Facility Range123
* Name of Disputed Asset\


**Claim Information**

* Comapny/Claim Status
* Information to be hidden
* Claimant ownership details

Once a claim is submitted by the seller, it is first displayed under the **"Pending Approval"** section in the user's dashboard. During this stage, the claim is not yet visible to funders and awaits administrative review.Simultaneously, in the **Admin Panel**, the submitted claim appears under the **Arbitration Claim Approval Management** section. Here, administrators are responsible for reviewing the claim. They have the authority to **approve**, **reject**, or **edit** the submission as needed to ensure accuracy and compliance.Once the claim is approved by the admin, it is automatically moved to the **"Arbitration"** section in the user's dashboard, indicating that the claim is now active and visible to verified funders on the platform.

**Claimant**

A **Claimant** refers to the **seller** who owns or is legally authorized to represent the mining project and list an arbitration claim on the platform. Only sellers are allowed to initiate and submit claims. Claimants must be registered users and have passed the platform’s verification process and should convert to seller to be eligible to list a claim.

Through their personal dashboard, claimants can monitor the status of their claims as they move through various stages:

* **Pending** – Awaiting admin review(Claim will be listed under pending section)
* **Approved** – Successfully listed and visible to verified funders and notification mail will be sent to both funders and claim listed user's(Claim will be moved to arbitration section)
* **Rejected** – Declined by the admin, with appropriate notification mail sent(Claim will remains in the pending section in the user dashboard).
